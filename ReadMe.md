# Credits
Thanks to [@Alex2262](https://github.com/Alex2262) for helping me debug a lot of the small bugs I had when I first started and then giving me validating ideas I had as my engine grew in strength.

Thanks to [@Ciekce](https://github.com/Ciekce) for helping me become a better C++ dev. He helped identify many of the places of undefined behavior in my code and generally pointed out many of the bad coding practices prevalent in my code.
